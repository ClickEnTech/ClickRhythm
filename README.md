Anna and Lucy identical twins share everything from a house, a bed and even a boyfriend.

Twin sisters fork out £130,000 on lip fillers, breast implants and tattooed eyebrows to make them look more similar (and they even share the same BOYFRIEND).

Australian-born Anna and Lucy DeCinque might just be the most 'identical' identical twins in the world.
he sisters, who were born just one minute apart, share everything -- a Facebook account, a job, a house, a car, and even a boyfriend. They have always been inseparable, going to the same nursery, primary and secondary schools. They also enrolled in the same beauty course in college. And as if being naturally identical wasn't enough, they've actually spent over $200,000 on plastic surgery just to look even more like each other.
